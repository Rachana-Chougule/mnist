# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition with k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains an implementation of a simple handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset and the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The purpose of this project is to showcase the effectiveness of KNN in classifying handwritten digits accurately. The implementation is done solely using the NumPy library.

## MNIST Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each measuring 28x28 pixels. These images are split into a training set of 60,000 samples and a test set of 10,000 samples. The dataset is labeled, meaning each image is associated with its corresponding digit label.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

The KNN algorithm is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm that is widely used in various machine learning tasks. It is based on the idea that similar instances are likely to belong to the same class. KNN operates by storing all available training data points in memory and, given a new input, identifies the k nearest neighbors based on a distance metric. The majority class among these neighbors is then assigned to the input as its predicted label.

## Implementation Details

In this project, we have implemented the KNN algorithm to classify the MNIST handwritten digit images using only the NumPy library. Here's a brief overview of the steps involved:

### Data Loading: 
The MNIST dataset is loaded using the NumPy library. The dataset is divided into training and test sets.
### Data Preprocessing: 
Before feeding the data to the KNN algorithm, some preprocessing steps may be required. This can include reshaping the images into a suitable format, normalizing the pixel values, or reducing the dimensionality of the data. These preprocessing steps are implemented using NumPy operations.
### Training: 
The training phase of the KNN algorithm is very fast because it simply stores all the training instances in memory using NumPy arrays.
### Prediction: 
For each instance in the test set, the KNN algorithm calculates the distance to all training instances and selects the k nearest neighbors. The predicted label is determined by the majority vote of the labels of these neighbors. NumPy is used for efficient distance calculations and array manipulations.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how the KNN algorithm can be used for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The implementation showcases the power of the NumPy library in handling the data preprocessing, training, prediction, and evaluation steps of the algorithm. Feel free to modify and extend the code to suit your specific needs or to apply the KNN algorithm to other image classification problems. Enjoy exploring the fascinating world of machine learning!
